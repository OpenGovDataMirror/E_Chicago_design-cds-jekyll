# Hi folks

Just a quick note: These favicon files are here for reference.

Jekyll theming does not allow for the inclusion of assets like favicons as part of a theme.
However, it's a best practice to put those favicons in the root of the folder. So, if you have this folder locally, or if you're digging around in this code repository online, just copy and paste the other files in this directory to the root of your web publishing project.
